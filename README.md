You can run the app using one of these methods:

#### 1. **Pre Build APK**

    - Download Pre Build APK inside Releses

#### 2. **Development Build**        
    - I am recommending that run this using Development Build Becouse  file saving and some other funtions are not supported development servers like expo client 
    - some fetures may need for run development build like "adb" ,emulator or USB Debbuging anabled Mobile Device Please do your reserch 
    i cannot include all thigs 

    - if you need quick fix then run prebuild APK file

## **Features**

- Generate QR codes from text or URLs.
- Save generated QR codes to your device's gallery.
- Input validation to ensure valid text or URLs.

---

## **Permissions**

The app uses `expo-media-library` to save QR codes to your device's gallery. You may need to grant permissions when prompted.

---

## **Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   If you encounter errors related to missing dependencies, delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies:
   ```
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

2. **Expo Version Mismatch**
   If there are issues related to Expo versions, try upgrading/downgrading Expo CLI or dependencies:
   ```
   npx expo upgrade
   ```

3. **Permission Errors**
   If saving QR codes fails, ensure permissions are granted for accessing media libraries.
